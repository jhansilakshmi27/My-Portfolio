              As a student, I‚Äôve personally experienced how time-consuming and frustrating it can be to find the right course materials, understand grading schemes, or even just get a sense of what to expect from a particular professor. There‚Äôs no single place that gives honest, crowd-sourced, and well-organized academic insights. That‚Äôs exactly the gap I wanted to help fill with KSP.<br /><br />
              This project wasn‚Äôt just a development task for me‚Äîit felt personal. I know how it feels to waste hours looking for the right notes or choosing a course blindly. So, I wanted to build something that could make a real difference, starting with my own academic circle.

              The project already had a basic foundation with some initial pages like Home, Notes, PYQs, and a Course page. But there was no user profile setup, and the platform lacked interactivity and engagement features. That‚Äôs where my work began.

              I built the user profile module from the ground up‚Äîeverything from designing the frontend (<b>profile.tsx</b>) to setting up backend endpoints and database structure.
               <ul style={{ margin: "8px 0 8px 18px", textAlign: "center" }}>
                <li>Editable user profiles with dynamic updates</li>
                <li>Persistent data storage so that profile data doesn‚Äôt reset</li>
                <li>Seamless navigation from profile to discussion</li>
                <li>A full discussion page with edit, like, and delete options for messages</li>
              </ul>
              This phase was also my first real dive into backend development‚Äîand honestly, it transformed how I think about full-stack applications.

              In Phase 2, I worked on making the platform more personalized and scalable by adding college-specific templates.
              <ul style={{ margin: "8px 0 8px 18px", textAlign: "center" }}>
                <li>Designed a pop-up system on the homepage that prompts users to log in and fill in college details</li>
                <li>Built a college card system where users can add/edit templates and switch colleges</li>
                <li>Implemented a search bar and popularity-based sorting using likes/stars</li>
              </ul>
              I focused on simplifying the file structure and learning from earlier mistakes‚Äîthis helped in easier debugging and made development smoother.

              When I started, backend development was completely new territory for me. But through this project, I learned to:
              <ul style={{ margin: "8px 0 8px 18px" }}>
                <li>Understand the flow of data in a full-stack system</li>
                <li>Design API endpoints and ensure state persistence</li>
                <li>Debug real-world issues that arise during frontend-backend integration</li>
              </ul>
              From fixing card duplication bugs to dealing with missing state updates on refresh, every challenge taught me something valuable.

              KSP wasn‚Äôt just about building features‚Äîit was about building something meaningful for the student community. It helped me grow technically, taught me the importance of clean structure, and most importantly, gave me a real taste of what it means to solve a problem that hits close to home.
              <br /><br />
              This is just the beginning. The platform still has a long way to go, and I‚Äôm excited to see how it evolves with contributions from more like-minded folks.
